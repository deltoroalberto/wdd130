        <p>Hi everyone, My name is Alberto Del Toro, I am from Nicaragua but actually I'm living in United State, I love to play soccer and read books
            I study business administration in my country, but I have developed a passion for programming when I discovered what one can do with a few lines of code. I have discovered that it is through practice that one can develop their talents.
            I hope to have the opportunity to contribute and help some of you develop in this learning process.
        </p>

        <h2>Nicaragua</h2>
        <img src="images/flagnica.jpg" alt="Nicaragua Flag" />
        <p>Nicaragua is often referred to as 'the country of lakes and volcanoes' because of its many lakes, 
            lagoons and a string of some 40 volcanoes stretching northwest to southeast along the Pacific coast.
            One of the Top Places To See in Nicaragua, Ometepe island is a hidden gem and a must-see on your Central American trip.
             Made of a perfectly-formed strata-volcano and it’s dormant twin, complete with cloudforest. 
            It’s the highlight of many people’s time here. It’s lush, hospitable, easy to get to and has great coffee plantations.
